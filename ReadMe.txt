The story in this game is the slow-witted(whatever you call, I just feel quite hard to describe this character)

want to rescue the princess who was kept for a time period, however finally find out that the princess is a monster

Once the health of main character drop to 0, the game is over...

The game is seperated in 3 scenes

Scene 1(Normal):
   Basically, use w,a,d to move the character..

Scene 2(Random G-land):
   Same as Scene 1, yet this time the gravity of the land will change randomly.Watch out the squares that will 
give you damages....

Scene 3(Draw land):
  Before hit the 'THING':Draw shape guiding the character to the 'THING'.Use BACKSPACE to clear the polys
  After hit the 'THING': the health drop to 1 as well as the character unlock a new ability,
			 he(or it) now can use frozen magic to freeze the generator (press 'f') in Scene 2.
			 Meanwhile, he(or it) can also be dragged...(I think that would be much more easier to pass Scene2)

Back to Scene 1:
  Dialog...Dialog...Dialog...Dialog...Game over..
